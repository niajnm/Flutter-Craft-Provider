# Flutter MVVM + Repository Pattern Base Template

This is a base template for building Flutter applications using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern along with the Repository pattern. It provides a structured approach to organizing your code, making it easier to maintain and test.

## Overview

MVVM is a design pattern that separates the presentation layer (View) from the business logic (ViewModel) and the data (Model). It promotes a clear separation of concerns and facilitates unit testing.

The Repository pattern abstracts the data layer and provides a clean interface for accessing data from multiple sources, such as local storage, network requests, or in-memory cache.

## Features

- Separation of concerns: The application is divided into layers - View, ViewModel, and Model.
- Testability: Each layer can be tested independently, allowing for easier unit testing.
- Scalability: The architecture scales well with larger applications, making it easier to add new features or refactor existing ones.
- Modularization: Code is organized into modules, making it easier to manage and reuse.
